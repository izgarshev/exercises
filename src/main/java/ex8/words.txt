Preface
Java is now over twenty years old, and the classic book, Core Java, covers, in
meticulous detail, not just the language but all core libraries and a multitude of
changes between versions, spanning two volumes and well over 2,000 pages.
However, if you just want to be productive with modern Java, there is a much faster,
easier pathway for learning the language and core libraries. In this book, I don't
retrace history and don't dwell on features of past versions. I show you the good
parts of Java as it exists today, with Java 9, so you can put your knowledge to work
quickly.
As with my previous "Impatient" books, I quickly cut to the chase, showing you
what you need to know to solve a programming problem without lecturing about the
superiority of one paradigm over another. I also present the information in small
chunks, organized so that you can quickly retrieve it when needed.
Assuming you are proficient in some other programming language, such as C++,
JavaScript, Objective C, PHP, or Ruby, with this book you will learn how to become
a competent Java programmer. I cover all aspects of Java that a developer needs to
know, including the powerful concepts of lambda expressions and streams. I tell you
where to find out more about old-fashioned concepts that you might still see in
legacy code, but I don't dwell on them.
A key reason to use Java is to tackle concurrent programming. With parallel
algorithms and threadsafe data structures readily available in the Java library, the
way application programmers should handle concurrent programming has
completely changed. I provide fresh coverage, showing you how to use the powerful
library features instead of error-prone low-level constructs.
Traditionally, books on Java have focused on user interface programming—but
nowadays, few developers produce user interfaces on desktop computers. If you
intend to use Java for server-side programming or Android programming, you will
be able to use this book effectively without being distracted by desktop GUI code.
Finally, this book is written for application programmers, not for a college course
and not for systems wizards. The book covers issues that application programmers
need to wrestle with, such as logging and working with files—but you won't learn
how to implement a linked list by hand or how to write a web server.
I hope you enjoy this rapid-fire introduction into modern Java, and I hope it will
make your work with Java productive and enjoyable.
